## 🚀 Features

- **Auto-Detection**: Fetches the latest list of Quest-eligible games directly from Discord.
- **Quest Queue**: Create a playlist of games. The app will run each for 15 minutes and 30 seconds (configurable) and automatically move to the next.
- **Custom Games**: Add any Discord Application ID manually to support new or unlisted games.
- **Queue Estimator**: Real-time estimation of when your quest queue will finish.
- **Modern UI**: Sleek dark mode design with glassmorphism and smooth animations.
